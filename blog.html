        Unless somebody leads, nobody will.

        Yesterday, I was riding the MAX home and towards the end of my ride, the overweight 50-year old lady next to me gets up and says, “Shame on you” as she left, her finger pointing at my face. First, I was puzzled. Then I realized it must have been because I did not give up my seat for another old, homeless-looking lady earlier.

        It struck something in me. I wanted to make excuses such as I have arthritis in my left ankle, and that if I don’t take care of myself, I won’t be able to take care of other people. But after some thinking, I should have given my seat up. The world is looking for leaders, and as a young person, I have to make sacrifices, even though it will be painful. So unless somebody leads, nobody will.

        3 weeks ago, I began a 4-month programming bootcamp in Portland, OR. The goal of the class is to learn Ruby on Rails in a 40-hour/week and pair-programming format. This means that every day, from 9-5pm, we work with a different partner to solve the daily objectives. This usually involves writing several web applications a day.

        I wasn’t sure what to expect going into the class. I didn’t have much time to think about it as I was admitted the week before it started. But there are all sorts of interesting people in the class with very different backgrounds, all wanting to learn code. There is a former pastor there, it’s been really interesting learning about and from him. The average age of the students is probably around 24-27 years old. The youngest probably being a few 21-year olds and a couple 40-50 year olds. All in all, Epicodus has done a pretty good job selecting students that like to work well together and they have been able to foster an environment conducive to learning where everyone collaborates to help each other.

        Unfortunately, even though they say not to compare yourself to other students, I find myself closer to the average or slightly below it in terms of our programming levels. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t discourage that I’m not learning as fast as others. But hopefully, something will click, and I can start progressing to be one of the faster learners.

        For the first 3 weeks, the skills we have learned are Ruby, writing with Atom, using the CMD prompt, deploying to Sinatra and Heroku, and PostgreSQL. Well, that’s all for now. It’s Friday and I have to finish a Code Review, which is a solo test to write a hair salon application that lets a salon owner enter stylists and clients into a database.

        <h5>My Thoughts</h5>

        The first thing that comes to my mind is, why is this such a big deal? As a Christian, I don’t understand why we don’t focus on bigger issues like making the world a better place?

        Jesus never condemned people. Even when they were sinning, Jesus met them where they were. He saw their hurting hearts and showed that he cared by really listening to them.

        Therefore it’s not our job to pass judgement. That’s God’s job. It’s like Billy Graham said, “It’s the Holy Spirit’s job to convict, God’s job to judge, and my job to love.”

        If we can just love people, I think we can make the world a better place. That’s probably more important than getting into fights and acting like one sin is better than another.

        Take Another Step

It is said that great writers don’t take days off. Many people let creativity come to them and on days when they don’t feel it, they take a day off. But sometimes one day can lead to two days and so forth. Everyday you must be building good habits. Therefore, like all things, such as faith, habits, and discipline, I will continue to motivate myself to be better. I won’t take a step back. But like that quote, “Sometimes you have to take one step back to take two steps forward”, right when I take that first step back, I will immediately take two steps forward.

      <p class="text-font-size">Accomplish Something

Today is the first of the week after my temporary position with Nike ended last Thursday. Now I have a lot of free time and there are many things I want to accomplish now. I’m so grateful for this free time because every now and then, you do need a time to reflect and think about what you want in life. It’s like Steve Jobs said, “The heaviness of being successful was replaced with the lightness of being a beginner again.” I intend of mastering a new craft like writing an app for our church.

Finish My Final

I also have a final for my MBA capstone due on Wednesday. I need to read about 10Barrel and the Beer Industry and answer some strategy questions.

Watch Visual Art

I get a lot of my inspiration from watching Anime, Movies, and other short inspirational clips. Hopefully knowledge and wisdom and creativity finds me today.</p>
